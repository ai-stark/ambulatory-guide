					<p>The Supporting Processes Category provides some of the underlying activities and concepts that are needed to support all of the other Categories. The Process Areas in this Category support the adoption and ongoing maintenance of all of the data management processes described in this document. Supporting Processes include the following Process Areas:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="#section5.1">Measurement and Analysis</a>: Identifies how the practice can measure the effectiveness of how they have implemented data management processes.</li>
						<li><a href="#section5.2">Process Management</a>: Assists the practice with developing work products, such as best practices, policies, procedures, the business glossary, etc.</li>
						<li><a href="#section5.3">Process Quality Assurance</a>: Focuses on making improvements in how the data management processes are implemented.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Summary</h3>

					<p>The Data Quality Assessment process area focuses on measuring the quality of the data itself, while the Measurement and Analysis process area focuses on measuring progress with instituting the data management processes. Measuring this progress will help the practice justify the time and expense of such process improvements and allow the practice to change direction if processes are not working. Practices can develop a set of measures that will help them ensure they are making progress. These measures can be as simple as setting a goal for how often a governance committee meets and tracking what decisions are made. Measures can also be more complex, such as analyzing whether the data lifecycle information has been integrated into the business glossary. Practices may realize the following benefits, if they build measurement and analysis into their data management processes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Focus and motivate improvement processes;</li>
						<li>Demonstrates actual versus planned progress; and</li>
						<li>Helps identify process issues.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Summary</h3>

					<p>As practices create work products, like the business glossary, data lifecycle mapping, policies, procedures, best practices, and measurement plans, they need to ensure that all of these work products are appropriately maintained and available to staff members. Process management is meant to build a process for maintaining these documents and proactively identifying any issues that might arise with any of the data management processes. This may be as simple as creating a shared drive where all staff members can access the documents or creating an internal SharePoint or other Intranet site where the documents can be kept. Smaller practices may also create binders with printed copies of the best practices and policies. As part of process management, practices should identify a small set of staff members who have the ability to edit work products, and determine methods for making sure two individuals are not making conflicting edits at the same time. Properly managing these work products should help practices realize the following benefits:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Organized and easily accessible information for all staff members;</li>
						<li>Increased awareness of best practices; and</li>
						<li>Increased efficiency by making all work products easily accessible.</li>
					</ul>

							</td>

								<p>As staff members create work products, they should store them in an easily accessible location, where all individuals who are involved in the process can view the documents. Practices should proactively identify any issues that might arise, such as confusion about how to perform a step in the process. These issues should be documented and shared with the larger group, so that they can be addressed in a timely way.</p>

					<h3>Summary</h3>

					<p>Process quality assurance is focused on making sure that both new and existing data management processes are performed correctly and that high quality products are created. Practices should make sure that as they develop the business glossary, best practices, procedures, data lifecycles, etc. that all the products they create are accurate, up-to-date, and understandable to all relevant staff members. Process quality improvement also helps the practice ensure that each of the process areas are working together. For example, the individuals who are responsible for process quality improvement would review both the data lifecycle and the business glossary to ensure they work together and do not have different sets of patient demographic data elements in them. These types of cross checks make sure that all work products and processes are high quality and can be utilized by staff members. Process quality improvement also ensures that staff members are following the data management processes.  Process quality improvement may lead to the following benefits:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Ensure that processes aimed at improving patient demographic data quality are consistently followed;</li>
						<li>Identify any issues with implementing data management processes so they can be addressed; and</li>
						<li>Provide insight for executive management on how the data management process is improving.</li>
					</ul>

						<tr>
							<td>
								<p><strong>1.1.</strong> <i>Are issues with data management processes and work products identified by staff members performing the process, and addressed by staff members who are responsible for the process?</i></p>
							</td>
							<td>
								<p>As practices create new processes, procedures, and best practices, as well as work products like the business glossary and data lifecycle, they should work to identify any issues that might arise. For example, if a policy says that a clinician should modify patient demographic data, like name or date of birth, but the approved metadata indicates that users in that role do not have access to modify that data, the issue should be identified and brought to the attention of the individual responsible for the policy. These types of cross checks between documents and processes will make sure that the data management process is successful.</p>

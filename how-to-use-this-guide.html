				<p>The PDDQ Framework and Ambulatory Guidance document are organized into five categories. Each category has a number of process areas that describe what activities should be occurring to improve patient demographic data quality as part of each category. Many of the process areas work together, so there is not necessarily a single starting place for implementing each process area; rather, practices should start with the process area that aligns with their priorities. The diagram below demonstrates how the PDDQ Framework works together to provide comprehensive data quality.</p>

				<p>In this guide, each process area will have a goal statement (what implementation of items in the process area is meant to achieve) and a short summary, including the key benefits of improved practices in each area. Then, there is a table that contains a series of questions (which are also in a companion spreadsheet) that will help practices evaluate their current status. The analysis of current practices is best accomplished by pulling together stakeholders from across the practice, if available, or by identifying a single individual who has deep knowledge of the practice and its EHR/practice management system. Ambulatory practices should first review the question, and if the answer is Not Met, review the best practices/implementation guidance column to understand how these items can be implemented in the practice to achieve a positive result on that question. If the answer is Fully Met, practices should record how the organization is currently performing the process, specifying examples, in the accompanying scoring spreadsheet. If the answer is Partial, the best practices which do correspond to the implemented portion should be noted, as well as any gaps. More advanced practices should review the PDDQ Framework for additional questions, if they have already met the majority of the items in the Ambulatory Guide.</p>

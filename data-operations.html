				<p>The Data Operation Category focuses on where patient demographic data comes from, how it is used in a system, and the staff members who have access to enter, modify, archive, or delete patient demographic data.  Data Operations help practices understand more about the data itself and how it is used, which is then used by the Data Management Function process area to coordinate the development and management of the Business Glossary, and the policies, best practices, and procedures developed under the Data Cleansing and Improvement Process Area.  The Data Operations Category includes the following process areas:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#section3.1">Data Requirements Definition</a>: Specifies which patient demographic data elements will be included in the business glossary, as well as the accompanying metadata and standards.</li>
					<li><a href="#section3.2">Data Lifecycle Management</a>: Identifies who can create and modify patient demographic data across the practice’s workflows and where it can be modified.</li>
					<li><a href="#section3.3">Data Provider Management</a>: Creates policies and best practices for individuals to follow when providing data, particularly when individuals are not staff members in the practice (i.e. laboratories, hospitals, other practices, etc.).</li>

				<h3>Summary</h3>

				<p>While the business glossary and corresponding metadata is the compilation of information about patient demographic data elements, data requirements definition is the process of identifying which data elements will be available in the practice’s EHR or practice management system. Data requirements also help the practice build its policies and best practices, by ensuring they have included all relevant patient demographic data elements.  Data requirements definition can take place via the data governance process if the practice has established a formal process, or be coordinated by the data management function, if an individual has been identified to fulfill that role.  The data requirements definition process enables the activities that take place in the data governance and data quality categories.  Data requirements definition can lead to the following benefits:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Increases the ability to share data across the organization and among organizations;</li>
					<li>Enhances the business glossary and corresponding metadata; and</li>
					<li>Establishes data ownership and stewardship.</li>
				</ul>

							<p><strong>1.1.</strong> Has the practice developed data requirements and linked them with the business glossary and corresponding metadata?</p>
						</td>
						<td>
							<p>When practices build their business glossary, they should also build out their data requirements.  As discussed in the Business Glossary, Metadata, and Data Standards process area, EHR/practice management systems likely have a set of patient demographic data elements that they use to match patient records.  In addition, there may be federal regulatory requirements that impact which patient demographic data elements are essential.  Practices should first work with their vendors to understand the data requirements that their system natively has and use this as a starting place for understanding their current data requirements.  Then, the practice can add to or enhance data requirements, based on their patient panel.  For example, in some geographic regions, it is common to have a high number of patients with the same first and last name, or similar names with the same birthday (for example, areas with a high Somali population may see the same birthdate of 01/01/YY, since culturally, this population does not have the concept of a birthday and are assigned the same birthday when they arrive in the U.S.).  Based on some of these cultural and geographical differences, practices may want to add data requirements beyond their system requirements, such as capturing the mother’s maiden name, to help them get more accurate record matching.</p>

							<p><strong>1.2.</strong> Is a data requirements definition process for patient data documented and followed?</p>

						<td>
							<p>As practices become more sophisticated with their technology and governance processes, they can benefit from having a standard data requirements definition process.  This process could be used by practices when they are switching systems or adding a new one, to ensure that they are using the same best practices and policies across all data entry points, including new systems. Practices that have set up a governance process would use this process to create the data requirements definition process and identify when such a process would be used.</p>

				</div>

				<h3>Summary</h3>

				<p>A data lifecycle traces the path of patient demographic data from the time it is created to the time it is archived.  For example, a registrar creating a new patient record for a patient’s first visit would be the start of the data lifecycle.  After a patient dies, and their record is marked as deceased, the lifecycle would end, since data about that patient should no longer be changing.  The data lifecycle helps identify who can enter and modify patient demographic data across the practice, and may even include individuals and organizations outside of the practice, like laboratories or pharmacies.  Identifying a patient demographic data lifecycle may provide the following benefits:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Minimize and eliminate unwanted and incorrect changes to patient demographic data;</li>
					<li>Improve the ability to identify root cause issues with data quality;</li>
					<li>Improve overall data management.</li>
				</ul>

					<tr>
						<td>
							<p><strong>1.1.</strong> Is the patient demographic data lifecycle defined and understood by stakeholders?</p>
						</td>
						<td>
							<p><strong>Small practices:</strong> Small practices may find it easiest to identify some of the lifecycle items as part of their business glossary and metadata capture.  Mainly, identifying who can edit each patient demographic data element within each of their systems will be important for identifying issues and creating solutions.  For example, some EHR systems prevent clinical staff from editing patient demographic data, and limit access to identified individuals or roles.  Other systems may not have these requirements, so small practices should first collaborate with their EHR/practice management vendors to understand what restrictions can be setup, and ensure that they map those restrictions to the lifecycle/business glossary.</p>
							<p><strong>Medium-large practices:</strong> Medium and large practices may want to create a more comprehensive data lifecycle that maps patient demographic data from creation to archive/deletion (note that HIPAA requires patient data be kept for at least 7 years).  A more comprehensive lifecycle would map demographic data elements to particular uses, for example: patient billing, insurance claims, treatment, etc., and ensure that key information about each use is recorded.  They may also create data flow diagrams that trace patient demographic data throughout the uses described above, including when data is shared externally and received from external organizations.</p>

				<h3>Summary</h3>

				<p>Data providers are individuals and systems that provide patient demographic data to a practice.  This includes internal data providers, such as front desk staff/registrars, medical assistants, etc., as well as external data providers, such as laboratories, pharmacies, and other provider offices.  Systems can also provide data, for example, the practice’s patient portal may allow patients to change their demographic data and send it to the practice to update in the EHR or practice management system.  It is important that all of these data providers understand the policies, best practices, and procedures that the practice has established for patient demographic data and follow the same whenever possible.  Some practices may do this via service level agreements that set requirements for data providers and establish escalation procedures when the agreements are not met.  Implementing data provider management practices may help the practice realize the following benefits:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Ensure that the right data is delivered to systems;</li>
					<li>Improve data quality from external sources; and</li>
					<li>Reduce patient safety risk by accepting more complete and accurate data.</li>
				</ul>

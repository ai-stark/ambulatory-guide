				<h2 class="section-h2">Introduction</h2>
				<p>Patient demographic data is the primary information that is used to match patient records across the healthcare system, and most patient demographic data originates in ambulatory practices, where patients seek the majority of their care. Consequently, capturing accurate and consistent patient demographic data in ambulatory practices is important to ensuring that patient records can be matched correctly wherever they seek care, averting patient safety issues when records are incorrectly matched. The Patient Demographic Data Quality Framework (the PDDQ Framework) is a comprehensive model that provides detailed methods and processes for managing patient demographic data throughout its lifecycle. This guidance document has pulled out the key items from the Framework that are most applicable to ambulatory practices. For more detailed information, each process area in this guidance document can be traced back to the Profile, to evaluate current practices in greater depth and implement a more comprehensive data quality plan.</p>
				
				<h2 class="section-h2">Goal</h2>
				<p>The goal of the Ambulatory Guidance document is to help ambulatory practices identify areas where patient demographic data quality can be improved, and provide best practices and implementation guidance to make improvements over time.</p>

				<h2 class="section-h2">Scope</h2>
				<p>The ambulatory guidance document is intended for small, medium, and large ambulatory practices, particularly those that operate independently from a health system. While many of the best practices are widely applicable across the healthcare system, health systems and health information organizations (HIOs) should review the guidance documents specific to their organizations.</p>

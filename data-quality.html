				<h3>Summary</h3>

				<p>A data quality plan generally includes data quality goals and objectives, data quality principles, issues that the organization will address, an identification of roles that are responsible for each portion of the plan, and any toolsets that will be used.  Practices are unlikely to have a data quality plan early on, since they may not know where their data quality issues exist.  However, as practices become more sophisticated with managing their data quality, they may find it helpful to create a plan that will help them profile, assess, and cleanse their data on an ongoing basis.  A data quality plan helps practices prioritize the areas for improvement, and therefore may start with identifying which of the patient demographic data elements that were identified in the business glossary should be focused on first.  Practices may realize the following benefits if they develop a data quality plan:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Move from ad hoc efforts to a planned and staffed quality process, which may decrease cost and save time;</li>
					<li>Have approved prioritization of efforts, which may create a “quality culture;” and</li>
					<li>Create reusable methods, procedures, techniques, etc., that can be tested and improved over time.</li>

				<h3>Summary</h3>

				<p>Data profiling is a first step in evaluating the quality of the patient demographic data elements that were identified in the business glossary.  Quality includes two aspects: 1) the completeness of the data being recorded; and 2) the accuracy of the data being recorded.  The quality of the patient demographic data will impact how often duplicate records are created.  Practices can perform data profiling either with tools that are provided by their vendor (for example, a report that shows which fields are blank most frequently) or through a manual review processes (i.e. looking at patient charts from the previous day’s panel).  The end goal of data profiling is to understand where issues lie with patient demographic data and identify areas of improvement in the quality of data being recorded.  Data profiling can provide the following benefits:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Identification of critical quality issues;</li>
					<li>Discovery of duplicate patient records; and </li>
					<li>Discovery of where existing policies and best practices are not being followed and identification of new policies, procedures, and best practices.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Summary</h3>
				
				<p>Data quality assessment involves creating metrics and thresholds around the quality of the data that is captured.  The data quality assessment is based on the findings of data profiling.  As a practice begins to understand where their largest data quality issues lie, they can start setting targets for improving the data quality.  Practices can measure multiple aspects of quality criteria as they impact patient demographic data: 1) Accuracy (e.g., correctly spelling data elements); 2) Completeness (e.g., how completely and often a data element is recorded); 3) Conformity and Consistency (e.g., is the data recorded in a standard format each and every time it is captured); 3) Timeliness (e.g., how often and quickly is a data element updated when it changes, like an address change); and 4) Uniqueness (e.g., duplicate patient record rates).  A data quality assessment process can provide the following benefits:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Measure tangible improvements in data quality;</li>
					<li>Deepens staff members understanding of the data elements and helps improve best practices;</li>
					<li>Create a “quality culture;” and</li>
					<li>Demonstrates that data quality is improving and that policies, best practices, and procedures are having their intended effect.</li>

Staff members should work together to establish reasonable metrics, based on what their EHR/practice management system allows them to measure.  For example, duplicate rates are a good measure on the quality of the data (lower duplicate rates mean better data quality); however, not all EHR/practice management systems are sophisticated enough to provide these metrics.  Practices should first work with their vendor to understand what reports their system can provide.  Based on their system capabilities, staff members can then begin to establish metrics, such as capturing email address X% of the time, or capturing address in the USPS format X% of the time.  Establishing these metrics will help staff members feel included and responsible for improving data quality, making them effective partners in the effort.</p>

				<h3>Summary</h3>
				
				<p>Once practices have identified problem areas in their data, they will need to cleanse existing data and build best practices and procedures to ensure that data quality issues do not persist.  The majority of data quality issues occur when data is initially entered or updated in a patient record.  Consequently, data cleansing and improvement should focus on the point of entry, which in most practices will be front desk staff or registrars.  Even when patients directly enter their data into a patient portal, a staff member should always review to ensure that there were no data entry errors on the part of the patient.  Practices may need to work with their EHR and patient portal vendor to create a process for notifying staff members when a patient has updated data in the portal.  Practices may see the following benefits from implementing data cleansing and improvement processes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Errors traced to root causes where problems can be corrected at their origin;</li>
					<li>Improved data quality by implementing process improvements; and</li>
					<li>Cost and time savings.</li>

Once practices have profiled their data and understand what the root problems are, they can work together to identify areas of improvement.  For example, if staff members consistently do not capture a specific data element, the practice can work with their EHR/practice management vendor to make the field required.  Likewise, if staff members are capturing data in the wrong field, they can work with their vendor to have field checks that ensure numerical data is captured for phone number and date of birth, while alphanumeric data is captured for fields like address.</p>
